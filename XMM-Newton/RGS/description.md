# XMM-Newton RGS data

## Object

This XMM-Newton RGS1 spectrum of Mrk 421 was taken for calibration purposes. Mrk 421 is an AGN which shows a variable absorbed powerlaw spectrum.

RGS response matrices are already multiplied by the effective area, so no ARF files are generated in the XMM SAS software.

Note that these files are ordered in wavelength instead of energy, which is different from the usual OGIP files.

We omit the RGS2 spectra, because they have exactly the same file format.
