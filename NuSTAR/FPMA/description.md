NuSTAR observation of the X-ray binary Vela X-1, from [Diez & al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...660A..19D/abstract) and [Diez & al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...674A.147D/abstract) with NuSTAR FPMA.

The source is a bright accreting pulsar, with a spectrum that can be described with a powerlaw and a high-energy cutoff, with a partial covering factor.
