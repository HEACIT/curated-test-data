Chandra ObsID 24781

This is a strong continuum spectrum from a type 1 Seyfert with possible super-imposed absorption lines.

This data is downloaded from TGCat (http://tgcat.mit.edu). Since the Chandra/HRC does not have sufficient energy resolution to separate orders, different diffraction orders have to be modelled at the same time. Since each RMF is pretty big (12 MB), this directory contains several simplifications compared to what would be done in a real analysis:

- The responses for negative orders are not included.
- Responses for only a few of the positive orders are included. This is not sufficient for science analysis, but enough to check the format for reading responses for multiple orders.
